Instructions: 
* Open this file in DrRacket (or your favorite plain-text editor) and add your answers 
  at the end of each line for each question. If you want to add more explanation or 
  justification, you may add one or more lines under the question.  Remember to add 
  your name as well.  Once complete, submit this to Learning Suite as a plain text file.
* For each of the correctness questions, indicate Yes (Y) or No (N).
