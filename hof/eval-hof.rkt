Assignment: Higher-Order Functions

Alan Moody

Instructions: 
* Open this file in DrRacket (or your favorite plain-text editor) and add your answers 
  at the end of each line for each question. If you want to add more explanation or 
  justification, you may add one or more lines under the question.  Remember to add 
  your name as well.  Once complete, submit this to Learning Suite as a plain text file.
* For each of the correctness questions, indicate Yes (Y) or No (N).
* For each of the documentation questions, indicate Yes (Y) or No (N).
* For each of the test case questions, indicate the line number of the corresponding
  test (or tests) using "L" and the number of the line.  For example, a test on
  line 61 of the file would be "L61".  If you don't have a particular test, put "N".
